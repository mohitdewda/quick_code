Send emails from PHP with ssmtp

The installation process:

	1. sudo apt-get install ssmtp

	2. Then edit the /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf file with this information:

		mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
		UseSTARTTLS=YES
		AuthUser=<YOUR-EMAIL>@gmail.com
		AuthPass=<YOUR-PASSWORD>

		(or any other SMTP-server that you might want to use)


	3. Find your php.ini file (usually in /etc/php5/cli/php.ini) and make sure the sendmail_path is:

		sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t

	4. Then restart your apache2-server with

		service apache2 restart

Now you can send outgoing emails with PHP!
