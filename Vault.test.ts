Certainly! Here are examples for both the `vaultService.ts` TypeScript file that contains the function to load vault secrets, and the corresponding test file `vaultService.test.ts` using Jest as the testing framework.

**vaultService.ts**

```typescript
// vaultService.ts

import * as vault from './path-to-vault-module'; // Adjust the path as necessary

export const loadVaultSecrets = async (): Promise<void> => {
  if (process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS !== 'true') {
    try {
      const vaultContent = process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH 
        ? await vault.read({ retries: 3, delay: 1000, path: process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH })
        : null;

      if (vaultContent) {
        const vaultSecrets = vault.parse(vaultContent);
        if (Object.keys(vaultSecrets).length > 0) {
          process.env = {
            ...process.env,
            ...vaultSecrets,
          };
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load vault secrets:', error);
      throw error; // Or handle it as per your error handling policy
    }
  }
};
```

**vaultService.test.ts**

```typescript
// vaultService.test.ts

import { loadVaultSecrets } from './vaultService';
import * as vault from './path-to-vault-module'; // Adjust the path as necessary

// Mocking the vault module
jest.mock('./path-to-vault-module', () => ({
  read: jest.fn(),
  parse: jest.fn()
}));

describe('loadVaultSecrets', () => {
  const originalProcessEnv = process.env;

  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    process.env = { ...originalProcessEnv };
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    process.env = originalProcessEnv;
  });

  it('loads secrets when DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS is not true', async () => {
    process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'false';
    process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH = '/fake/path';
    const mockSecrets = { secretKey: 'secretValue' };
    (vault.read as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(mockSecrets);
    (vault.parse as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue(mockSecrets);

    await loadVaultSecrets();

    expect(vault.read).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ retries: 3, delay: 1000, path: '/fake/path' });
    expect(process.env.secretKey).toEqual('secretValue');
  });

  it('does not load secrets when DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS is true', async () => {
    process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'true';

    await loadVaultSecrets();

    expect(vault.read).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  // Add more tests to cover other cases, such as errors during reading the vault
});
```

In the test file, make sure you're mocking the actual vault module correctly, and that you're handling asynchronous code properly. The `jest.fn()` is used to create mock functions, and `mockResolvedValue` is used to mock the resolution of a promise returned by an async function. Adjust these examples as needed to fit your actual vault module's API and behavior.


Certainly! Let's go through each line of the `vaultService.test.ts` file that you provided:

```typescript
import { loadVaultSecrets } from './vaultService';
```
This line imports the `loadVaultSecrets` function from your `vaultService` module, which you want to test.

```typescript
import * as vault from './path-to-vault-module';
```
Here, you're importing the entire vault module that you're using within `vaultService.ts` so that you can mock its methods later in the tests.

```typescript
jest.mock('./path-to-vault-module', () => ({
  read: jest.fn(),
  parse: jest.fn()
}));
```
This tells Jest to mock the `vault` module. The `read` and `parse` functions are replaced with mock functions (`jest.fn()`), which allows you to control their implementation in your tests.

```typescript
describe('loadVaultSecrets', () => {
```
`describe` is a Jest method that groups together one or more tests. Everything inside this block is part of the `loadVaultSecrets` test suite.

```typescript
  const originalProcessEnv = process.env;
```
This line stores the original `process.env` object so that it can be restored after the tests, preventing tests from polluting the global `process.env`.

```typescript
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    process.env = { ...originalProcessEnv };
  });
```
`beforeEach` is a hook that runs before each test in the `describe` block. It's clearing all mock implementations and instances with `jest.clearAllMocks()` and resetting `process.env` to its original state.

```typescript
  afterAll(() => {
    process.env = originalProcessEnv;
  });
```
`afterAll` is a hook that runs after all the tests in the `describe` block have completed. It restores the original `process.env` object.

```typescript
  it('loads secrets when DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS is not true', async () => {
```
`it` is a Jest method that defines an individual test case. This particular test case checks the behavior when `DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS` is not true.

```typescript
    process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'false';
    process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH = '/fake/path';
```
These lines set the environment variables for the test case to simulate the conditions under which the `loadVaultSecrets` function should attempt to load secrets.

```typescript
    const mockSecrets = { secretKey: 'secretValue' };
```
This creates a mock object to represent the secrets that would be loaded from the vault.

```typescript
    (vault.read as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(mockSecrets);
```
This tells the Jest mock function for `vault.read` to return a resolved promise with the `mockSecrets` object when called.

```typescript
    (vault.parse as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue(mockSecrets);
```
Similarly, this line sets the Jest mock function for `vault.parse` to return the `mockSecrets` object when called.

```typescript
    await loadVaultSecrets();
```
This line actually calls the `loadVaultSecrets` function, which will invoke the mocked `vault.read` and `vault.parse` functions.

```typescript
    expect(vault.read).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ retries: 3, delay: 1000, path: '/fake/path' });
```
Here, Jest checks that `vault.read` was called with the expected arguments.

```typescript
    expect(process.env.secretKey).toEqual('secretValue');
```
This asserts that `process.env` was updated with the `secretKey` from the mock secrets, checking if the `loadVaultSecrets` function behaves as expected.

```typescript
  });
```
This closes the individual test case block.

```typescript
  it('does not load secrets when DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS is true', async () => {
```
This begins another individual test case where `DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS` is set to true to ensure that the function does not attempt to load secrets.

```typescript
    process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'true';
```
Here, the environment variable is set to disable reading from the vault.

```typescript
    await loadVaultSecrets();
```
The `loadVaultSecrets` function is called again under these new conditions.

```typescript
    expect(vault.read).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
```
Jest verifies that `vault.read` was not called, which would mean the function behaved correctly under the condition that reading is disabled.

```typescript
  });
```
This closes the second test case block.

```typescript
  // Add more tests to cover other cases, such as errors during reading the vault
});
```
This comment suggests adding more test cases to cover additional scenarios

Testing negative scenarios typically involves simulating errors or unexpected behavior and ensuring that your code handles these situations correctly. In the context of your `loadVaultSecrets` function, negative tests could include simulating a failure to read the vault secrets or handling a case where the vault secrets are in an unexpected format.

Here's how you might write negative tests for the `loadVaultSecrets` function:

```typescript
// Continuing from the previous test suite...

it('throws an error if reading from the vault fails', async () => {
  process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'false';
  process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH = '/fake/path';

  // Simulate a read error
  const readError = new Error('Failed to read from vault');
  (vault.read as jest.Mock).mockRejectedValue(readError);

  await expect(loadVaultSecrets()).rejects.toThrow(readError);
});

it('does not set environment variables if the vault returns no secrets', async () => {
  process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'false';
  process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH = '/fake/path';

  // Simulate vault returning an empty object
  (vault.read as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue({});
  (vault.parse as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({});

  await loadVaultSecrets();

  // Check that no new environment variables were set
  expect(Object.keys(process.env)).not.toContain('secretKey');
});

it('does not set environment variables if the vault returns a non-object', async () => {
  process.env.DISABLE_VAULT_SECRETS = 'false';
  process.env.VAULT_SECRETS_PATH = '/fake/path';

  // Simulate vault returning a non-object (like a string or null)
  (vault.read as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue('not-an-object');
  (vault.parse as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue('not-an-object');

  await loadVaultSecrets();

  // Check that process.env does not have the string 'not-an-object'
  expect(process.env).not.toEqual(expect.stringContaining('not-an-object'));
});
```

In these negative test cases:

- The first test simulates a scenario where the `read` method of the vault module fails. It uses `mockRejectedValue` to simulate a rejection of the promise returned by `vault.read`, then checks to ensure that the error is thrown as expected using `expect(...).rejects.toThrow`.
  
- The second test simulates the vault returning an empty object, meaning there are no secrets to add to the environment. It checks to ensure that no
